# NOTE FOR FUTURE ME
# 
# We conceptually only want to run this after our one-time setup.
# The setup step adds a deploy key to our secrets, and we need access to that deploy key.
#
# Unfortunately, GitHub Actions seems to fetch "secrets" once, when first parsing a .yml file
# This means, if we shove these two jobs into the same file, this second job doesn't have access to
# the not-created-yet secret.
# 
# The only long-term solution I can see is having the "iOS One-Time Setup" job export the deploy key as an output.
# This would unfortunately involve updating the fastlane plugin to output the key as an env var, 
# then add an additional command to output that env var as a step output
# 
# I experimented with having this workflow hit the GitHub API to fetch the deploy key, 
# since that can happen at runtime, but the GH API intentionally does not return raw repo secret values.
# They are ONLY able to be accessed by GH-maintained workflow infrastructure, and thus
# can only be fetched at the start of a workflow run.
